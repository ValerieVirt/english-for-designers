## About me
Hi again! 
I specialize in creating printed materials, logos, and visual campaigns, aiming for clean and meaningful designs. I enjoy working in a team, as I believe collaboration brings fresh perspectives and inspiration. I'm excited about new challenges and projects that allow me to further develop my skills.  
 
 
### Little more.. 
 I grew up in a family of artists. 
 Their influence nurtured my passion for both music and visual arts from an early age. I chose to pursue a path in graphic design, which I first studied in high school and am now continuing at university.

 
Let’s team up to build a unique look for your brand!
