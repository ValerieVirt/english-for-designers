## Design Happens Together

Hi, I’m Valerie,
and I’ve learned that design is never a solo job. 

Yes, there are quiet moments when I work alone — sketching, adjusting, refining details.
But the work that truly matters always happens with others.

For me, teamwork is where design becomes real.
In the conversations.
In the questions that challenge me.
In the moment someone shares an unexpected idea — and suddenly, the whole direction becomes clearer.

I enjoy bringing structure and calm into creative chaos.
I like it when things make sense.
But I’ve also learned that clarity doesn’t come from working alone — it comes from listening, discussing, and staying open to change.

A project that truly showed me the power of collaboration was the redesign of the visual identity for Czech Tennis.
At the start, the team had many ideas:
Should we focus on the net? The racket? The ball?
What visual style feels right for this sport and this community?

We had open discussions and explored different directions.


I contributed by developing design concepts and visual ideas for merchandise, brand elements, and marketing communication.
We tested and refined different approaches until we found one that worked.

In the end, we created a unified identity inspired by the tennis ball and its trajectory.
Simple. Dynamic. Playful. Full of energy.
A design that felt right not just for us, but for the people who love tennis.

This experience reminded me of what I believe as a designer:
    Sometimes you have to slow down.
    Sometimes you have to let go of your first idea.
    And sometimes you simply need to be quiet and hear what others need.

I don’t want to be the person with “the best idea in the room.”
I want to be the one who helps everyone’s ideas work together.

Because good design should feel simple — even if it wasn’t simple to create.
It should feel like it belongs.
And that only happens when people collaborate, trust each other, and care about the process, not just the result.

That’s the kind of designer I am.
And the kind of team I’d love to be part of.




### Overview of Storytelling Principles and Key Elements
When I was preparing this talk, I thought a lot about what makes a story feel real and meaningful.
I realized that good storytelling — just like good design — needs a few key elements:

#### Honesty - being true to your own experience.
#### Structure - knowing where you’re taking the listener, even if the path feels simple.
#### Emotion - something that makes people feel connected — not just informed.
#### Voice - not being afraid to sound like you.

I wanted this story to be a story about the way I think, work, and grow — because that’s what I bring into a team.

### Applying Storytelling to This Talk
That’s why I chose to tell a story about collaboration — not a specific project, but the deeper process that runs through all of them.

I focused on:

A core belief that guides my design approach: that design is never a solo job.
A series of small but real moments — working alone, listening to others, letting go of an idea — to make the story feel grounded.
A clear progression: from belief → practice → reflection → invitation to connect.
Instead of presenting a portfolio, I wanted to present a mindset — to show not just what I do, but how I think.

### How I Developed This Talk
To write this talk, I started with one question:
“What do I believe about design that also says something about who I am?”

Then I did this:

I wrote down short thoughts, almost like journal entries — moments when I felt something clicked in a team.
I highlighted the ones that felt personal, honest, and true.
I shaped them into a flow: intro → insight → process → values → closing.
And finally, I read it out loud — several times — to make sure it sounds like me, not like a script.

I didn’t want it to be about impressing anyone. I wanted it to feel like a conversation — because that’s how I work best: in dialogue.
