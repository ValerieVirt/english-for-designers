Hi, I’m Valerie,
and one thing I’ve come to believe over time is that design is never a solo job. 
Of course, there are moments when I work alone — sketching ideas, moving things around, adjusting details. But the work that matters, the work that works — always happens with others.

For me, teamwork is where design becomes real.
It’s in the conversations, in the questions that challenge my assumptions, and in those moments when someone says something I hadn’t thought of — and suddenly, the whole thing clicks.
I’ve always been someone who enjoys bringing structure and calm into creative chaos. I like it when things make sense. But I’ve learned that clarity doesn’t come from working in isolation — it comes from talking to people, from listening, and from being open to change.
Sometimes that means slowing down.
Sometimes it means letting go of my first idea.
And sometimes it just means being quiet and hearing what others need.
That’s not always easy — but I think it’s one of the most important parts of being a designer.

I don’t want to be the person with “the best idea in the room.”
I want to be the person who helps everyone’s ideas work together.
In the end, I think good design should feel simple, even if it isn't simple to make.
It should feel like it belongs — like it fits.
And that only happens when people collaborate, trust each other, and care not just about the outcome — but also about the process.

That’s the kind of designer I try to be:
Focused, thoughtful, collaborative.
Someone who brings people together and helps things make sense — clearly, calmly, and with care.

That’s the kind of work I care about — and the kind of team I’d love to be part of.
