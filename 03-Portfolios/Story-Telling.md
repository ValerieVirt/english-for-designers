Hi, I’m Valerie,

and one thing I’ve come to believe over time is that design is never a solo job. 
Of course, there are moments when I work alone — sketching ideas, moving things around, adjusting details. But the work that matters, the work that works — always happens with others.

For me, teamwork is where design becomes real.
It’s in the conversations, in the questions that challenge my assumptions, and in those moments when someone says something I hadn’t thought of — and suddenly, the whole thing clicks.

I’ve always been someone who enjoys bringing structure and calm into creative chaos. I like it when things make sense. But I’ve learned that clarity doesn’t come from working in isolation — it comes from talking to people, from listening, and from being open to change.

Sometimes that means slowing down.
Sometimes it means letting go of my first idea.
And sometimes it just means being quiet and hearing what others need.

That’s not always easy — but I think it’s one of the most important parts of being a designer.

I don’t want to be the person with “the best idea in the room.”
I want to be the person who helps everyone’s ideas work together.
In the end, I think good design should feel simple, even if it isn't simple to make.
It should feel like it belongs — like it fits.
And that only happens when people collaborate, trust each other, and care not just about the outcome — but also about the process.

That’s the kind of designer I try to be:
Focused, thoughtful, collaborative.
Someone who brings people together and helps things make sense — clearly, calmly, and with care.

That’s the kind of work I care about — and the kind of team I’d love to be part of.


### Overview of Storytelling Principles and Key Elements
When I was preparing this talk, I thought a lot about what makes a story feel real and meaningful.
I realized that good storytelling — just like good design — needs a few key elements:

#### Honesty - being true to your own experience.
#### Structure - knowing where you’re taking the listener, even if the path feels simple.
#### Emotion - something that makes people feel connected — not just informed.
#### Voice - not being afraid to sound like you.

I wanted this story to be a story about the way I think, work, and grow — because that’s what I bring into a team.

### Applying Storytelling to This Talk
That’s why I chose to tell a story about collaboration — not a specific project, but the deeper process that runs through all of them.

I focused on:

A core belief that guides my design approach: that design is never a solo job.
A series of small but real moments — working alone, listening to others, letting go of an idea — to make the story feel grounded.
A clear progression: from belief → practice → reflection → invitation to connect.
Instead of presenting a portfolio, I wanted to present a mindset — to show not just what I do, but how I think.

### How I Developed This Talk
To write this talk, I started with one question:
“What do I believe about design that also says something about who I am?”

Then I did this:

I wrote down short thoughts, almost like journal entries — moments when I felt something clicked in a team.
I highlighted the ones that felt personal, honest, and true.
I shaped them into a flow: intro → insight → process → values → closing.
And finally, I read it out loud — several times — to make sure it sounds like me, not like a script.

I didn’t want it to be about impressing anyone. I wanted it to feel like a conversation — because that’s how I work best: in dialogue.
