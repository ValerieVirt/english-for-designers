# Design That Resonates  
*How Rebranding Hit the Right Notes at Prague Proms Festival*

---

## The Need for a Brand Refresh  
The original visual identity of Prague Proms was not consistent and didnâ€™t stand out, especially online. The festival connects classical music with modern styles, but the design didnâ€™t show this clearly. It needed a new look that felt elegant, memorable, and worked well in both print and digital formats.

## Setting the Tone: Research and Insights  
I studied the festivalâ€™s history, audience, and existing materials. I found that the old design didnâ€™t match the high quality of the concerts and didnâ€™t attract younger people. The festival needed a visual language that was clean, stylish, and emotionally engaging.

## From Sketch to Symphony: Solving Design Challenges  
The biggest challenge was to create a design that feels **both timeless and modern**. I decided to use **minimalist, but expressive visuals**, inspired by music and the elegance of art deco. My goal was to make the design easy to read and visually consistent across all materials.

## My Approach to Branding  
I created a **complete visual identity system**, including logo, printed materials (posters, programs, stationery), merchandise, and a **web design concept in Figma**.  
Key elements:  
- Elegant, modern typography  
- Simple line illustrations of musical instruments  
- Color palette with deep navy, ivory, and burgundy  
- User-friendly web design
