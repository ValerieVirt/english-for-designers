### ðŸŽ¼ What happens when classical music gets a modern makeover?  
This is how the rebranding of Prague Proms Festival combined tradition, modern style, and clear design â€“ all in perfect harmony.

# Design That Resonates  
*How Rebranding Hit the Right Notes at Prague Proms Festival*


## The Need for a Brand Refresh  
The original visual identity of Prague Proms was not consistent and didnâ€™t stand out, especially online. The festival connects classical music with modern styles, but the design didnâ€™t show this clearly. It needed a new look that felt elegant, memorable, and worked well in both print and digital formats.

I created the entire new identity from scratch, including print, digital, and web design.


## Setting the Tone: Research and Insights  
I studied the festivalâ€™s history, audience, and existing materials. I found that the old design didnâ€™t match the high quality of the concerts and didnâ€™t attract younger people. The festival needed a visual language that was clean, stylish, and emotionally engaging.


## From Sketch to Symphony: Solving Design Challenges  
The biggest challenge was to create a design that feels **both timeless and modern**. I decided to use **minimalist, but expressive visuals**, inspired by music and the elegance of art deco. My goal was to make the design easy to read and visually consistent across all materials.


## My Approach to Branding  
I created a **complete visual identity system**, including logo, printed materials (posters, programs, stationery), merchandise, and a **web design concept in Figma**.  
Key elements:  
- Elegant, modern typography
- Simple line illustrations of musical instruments
- Vibrant color palette with deep navy, ivory, and burgundy
- Intuitive and user-friendly website

*Web design focused on clarity, easy navigation, and consistent branding across pages.*


## The Results: Clear, Stylish, and Unified  
The new identity gives Prague Proms a **strong and professional appearance**. It connects with both long-time fans and new visitors. The design now matches the quality of the music and works smoothly in both physical and online spaces.


## What I Learned and Whatâ€™s Next  
This project showed me how **good design can support and improve cultural events**. Itâ€™s not just about how things look â€“ itâ€™s about helping people connect with the experience. In the future, I want to use this approach in other creative and cultural projects.


## Tools
To create the logo and choose the right typography, I used Adobe Illustrator â€“ itâ€™s precise and flexible.
For the website design, I worked in Figma. It helped me build a clean and easy-to-use layout.
I used Photoshop to finish high-quality visuals, and Adobe InDesign to keep all printed materials like programs and posters consistent.
I really enjoy working in InDesign â€“ itâ€™s my favorite!
