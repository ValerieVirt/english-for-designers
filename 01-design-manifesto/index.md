## Design Manifesto
1. **Clarity and Simplicity:** I believe that less is more. Every element in my design should have a purpose, with nothing unnecessary or excessive. Simplicity is powerful because it allows the message to shine through without distractions, creating a cohesive and intuitive experience.

2. **Purity:** I strive for clean and elegant designs that are visually light and easy to understand. Purity in design means stripping away clutter and focusing on what truly matters. I aim for a refined aesthetic that is easy on the eyes and brings a sense of calm.

3. **Meaningfulness:** Every visual detail in my designs has a reason to exist. I donâ€™t add elements just for the sake of aesthetics but to serve a functional purpose. I believe that design should be both beautiful and useful, with each component contributing to the overall message or experience.

4. **Functionality:** The primary goal of my designs is to simplify the complex. I prioritize usability and clarity to ensure that the end user can interact with the design effortlessly. A well-functioning design solves problems, reduces friction, and enhances the user experience.

5. **Visual Calm:** I aim to create designs that evoke a sense of peace and balance. Visual calm comes from thoughtful composition, whitespace, and harmony between elements. My goal is to provide an experience that feels intuitive, peaceful, and free of visual noise.
