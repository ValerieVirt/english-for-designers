## Design Manifesto

   1. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
In my opinion, less is more. Nothing in my design should be superfluous or superfluous; everything should have a function. Simplicity creates a unified and intuitive experience by letting the content shine through without interruptions.

3. **Honesty:** I strive for clean and elegant designs that are visually light and easy to understand. In design, purity entails removing extraneous elements and concentrating on what really counts. My goal is to create a sophisticated, visually pleasing, and peaceful style.

4. **Significance:** Every visual element in my designs has a specific function. I incorporate features not just for aesthetic reasons but also to have a practical purpose. Every component should contribute to the overall experience or message, and design should, in my opinion, be both aesthetically beautiful and useful.

5. **Usability:** Simplifying the complex is my main design objective. To make sure the end user can easily interact with the design, I place a high priority on usability and clarity. An effective design improves the user experience, lowers friction, and resolves issues.

6. **Visual Calm:** My goal is to produce designs that inspire a feeling of harmony and tranquility. Whitespace, elemental harmony, and careful composition all contribute to visual serenity. My intention is to provide an intuitive, serene, and visual noise-free experience.
